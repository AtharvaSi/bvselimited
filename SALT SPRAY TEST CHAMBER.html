              The salt spray test is a standardized and popular corrosion test method, used to check corrosion resistance of materials and surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and ﬁnished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. It is Double Walled (Stainless Steel304/ 316 inside & Outside also Stainless Steel) or the whole body made with high grade polypropylene.
              Control: Microprocessor based programmable digital controller cum indicator.
